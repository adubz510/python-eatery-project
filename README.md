# Live Site


## Summary

This is a full-stack clone of UberEats, a food delivery and restaurant ordering platform. The project allows users to browse restaurants, view detailed menus, add items to a shopping cart, and place orders. Core features include user authentication, restaurant and menu item CRUD functionality, real-time cart management, and a responsive search system. Users can also leave reviews for restaurants, view past orders, and quickly reorder from previous purchases.
